# Used Car Price Prediction
## Project Description
This project focuses on predicting the prices of used cars. The dataset used in this project is obtained from the Autotrader website, which includes information about various cars listed on the website. The goal of this machine learning project is to develop a model that can accurately predict the price of a used car based on its features.

The dataset contains 12 columns and 402,005 rows, representing different features of the cars. These features include public_reference (unique identifier), mileage, reg_code (registration code), standard_colour, standard_make, standard_model, vehicle_condition, year_of_registration, price, body_type, crossover_car_and_van, and fuel_type.

## Data Analysis
An analysis of the dataset reveals interesting insights. For numerical values, such as mileage and year_of_registration, there are outliers and missing values that need to be addressed. The minimum mileage value of 0 and the maximum value of 999,999 indicate the presence of outliers. Similarly, the year_of_registration column contains incorrect values, such as 999, which need to be cleaned.

Additionally, the dataset contains missing values, particularly in the year_of_registration, reg_code, and standard_colour columns. Attempts were made to fill these missing values based on the relationship between reg_code and year_of_registration, as well as the mode of corresponding columns. However, some missing values could not be accurately filled, and a decision was made to drop them from the dataset.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
To clean the dataset, several steps were taken. Outliers were removed from the year_of_registration, mileage, and price columns using the interquartile range method. Missing values were filled using appropriate techniques, such as leveraging the relationship between reg_code and year_of_registration and filling with the mode of corresponding columns.

## Model Development
After cleaning the dataset, a machine learning model was developed to predict the prices of used cars. Various algorithms were explored, including linear regression, decision tree, random forest, and gradient boosting. The performance of each model was evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as mean squared error and R-squared value.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project successfully addressed the challenge of predicting used car prices. By analyzing and cleaning the dataset, we were able to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the prices of used cars. The final model achieved a satisfactory level of performance, demonstrating the potential of machine learning in the automotive industry.

## Future Work
There are several avenues for future work on this project. Some potential areas for improvement include:

Collecting more comprehensive and up-to-date data to improve the accuracy of the model.
Exploring more advanced machine learning algorithms, such as neural networks, to further enhance the model's performance.
Incorporating additional features, such as car specifications and market trends, to capture more information about the cars and improve the predictions.
Conducting more in-depth analysis to identify specific factors that have a significant impact on the prices of used cars.
